description: "An example method for monitoring health and well-being of persons includes a processor integral to a video camera capturing video frames containing raw image data of a scene containing person objects and non-person objects. The processor, for a first video frame, executes video frame operations, including detecting the person objects in the first video frame, detecting and identifying the non-person objects in the first video frame, identifying and classifying a person object as a person for metric analysis, and determining a posture of the person. The method further includes the processor repeating the video frame operations for second and subsequent video frames; identifying changes in posture of the person from the second and subsequent video frames; using the changes in posture, determining motion of the person; providing person privacy, comprising automatically and immediately following each video frame operation on a video frame, deleting all raw image data of the video frame; and, based on the posture changes and the motion, generating a private, personalized metric analysis for the person. In an aspect, the private, personalized metric analysis includes outcome measures of interest selected from a group consisting of steps taken/distance walked/changes in gait by elderly persons, positional changes for bedridden persons, and developmental milestones in child persons; and the processor conducts the metric analysis over time to identify trends and corresponding changes in a health condition of the person, comprising progress in rehabilitation, deterioration from a degenerative disease, and physical and mental development."
