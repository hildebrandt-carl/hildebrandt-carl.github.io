I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia's [LESS Lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io), mentored by [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum). My academic foundation is rooted in a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pretoria, South Africa. At the core of my research is the intricate relationship between autonomous systems, software testing, and verification.

My research focuses on the complete testing pipeline, encompassing the creation of test suites, their execution, and evaluating their coverage. A driving force behind my research is the understanding that autonomous systems, while software-based, are intrinsically linked to hardware operating in the tangible world. This understanding necessitates an integrated approach to testing: one that synthesizes insights from software, hardware, and physical world interactions.

Outside the realm of academia, I am a passionate sportsperson, representing the University of Virginia in club field hockey and as a member of the triathlon team. My adventurous spirit is evident in personal milestones like summiting Kilimanjaro, completing the Comrades ultramarathon—the world’s oldest and most renowned—and earning a spot on the U18B South Africa National Hockey Team.
