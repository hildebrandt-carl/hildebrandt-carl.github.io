I am a Ph.D. student attending the University of Virginia, USA. I am part of the [LESS Lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io), and advised by [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum). I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. My research interests lie in the intersection between autonomous systems and software testing and verification. The key insight to my research is that although autonomous systems are extremely reliant on software, they operate in the real physical world. Thus when one considers how to test these systems, one should not rely solely on either software nor physical tests but rather create tests that steam from knowledge about both.

More specifically, in previous work, I have combined kinematic models (models that describe autonomous systems' physical capabilities) with parametrizable scoring models (models used to estimate an autonomous systems behavior, in part due to its software) to generate tests that stress the autonomous systems. I have also shown that autonomous systems kinematic models can be dramatically improved by considering the autonomous systems control software. Currently, I am focused on developing a full system testing simulator that allows mixed-reality testing. This is testing that combines elements from both reality and simulation.

Outside of the lab, I am an active member of the University of Virginia's club field hockey and triathlon team. I have summited Kilimanjaro, completed Comrades the world's oldest and largest ultramarathon, and I was part of the U18B South Africa National Hockey Team.
