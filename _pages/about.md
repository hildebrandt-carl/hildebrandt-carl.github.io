I am a Ph.D. student attending the University of Virginia, USA. I am part of the [LESS Lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io), and advised by [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum). I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. My research interests lie in the intersection between autonomous systems and software testing and verification. More specially, I have done work along the entire testing pipeline from test generation to test execution and test adequacy metrics. The key insight to my research is that although autonomous systems rely on software, they operate in the real physical world. Thus when one considers how to test these systems, one should not rely solely on either software or physical tests but rather create tests that stem from knowledge about both.

Outside of the lab, I am an active member of the University of Virginia's club field hockey and triathlon team. I have summited Kilimanjaro, completed Comrades (the world's oldest and largest ultramarathon), and I was part of the U18B South Africa National Hockey Team.
