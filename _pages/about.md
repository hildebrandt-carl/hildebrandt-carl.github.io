I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Virginia in the United States, where I am part of the [LESS Lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io) under the guidance of [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum). I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. My research focuses on the intersection of autonomous systems and software testing and verification. Specifically, I have explored various aspects of the testing pipeline, ranging from test generation to test execution and test adequacy metrics. The central premise of my research is rooted in recognizing that while autonomous systems are software systems, they rely on hardware operating in the physical real world. Thus when one considers how to test these systems, one should not rely solely on either software, hardware, or physical tests but rather create tests that stem from knowledge about all three.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively participate in the University of Virginia's club field hockey and triathlon team. In addition, I have accomplished notable personal achievements such as summiting Kilimanjaro, completing Comrades (the world's oldest and largest ultramarathon), and representing the U18B South Africa National Hockey Team.
