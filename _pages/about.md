I am a Ph.D. student attending the University of Virginia, USA. I am advised by [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum). I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. My research interests lie in the intersection between robotics and software testing and verification. My research's key insight is that although robotic systems are extremely reliant on software, they operate in the real physical world. Thus when one considers how to test these systems, one should not purely rely on either the software or physical tests but rather create tests that steam from knowledge about both.

More specifically, in previous work, I have combined the kinematic models that describe a robot's physical capabilities into the software testing procedures to verify the autonomous system is behaving as designed. I have also shown that the robot's kinematic models can be dramatically improved by considering the robot's control software. Currently, I am focused on developing a full system test called mixed-reality testing, which combines elements from both reality and simulation.

Outside of the lab, I am an active member of the University of Virginia's club field hockey and triathlon team. I have summited Kilimanjaro, completed Comrades the world's oldest and largest ultramarathon, and I was part of the U18B South Africa National Hockey Team.
