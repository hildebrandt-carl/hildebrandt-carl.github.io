title: "Southern Africa Road Trip"
excerpt: "After graduating, my friend and I decided to take a month off, rent a 4x4, and with a set of paper maps as our only companion set off on the trip of a lifetime. We drove many 1000's of kilometers through 4 different countries and made more memories than I can recall. More importantly, I got a small taste of the beauty, kindness, and heart of Southern Africa.<br/><img src='/images/extra/trip.jpeg'>"
