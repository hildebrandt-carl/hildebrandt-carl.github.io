title: "Comrades Marathon"
excerpt: "The Comrades marathon is an 89km (55 mi) race run annually in South Africa. Not only is the course long, but it also includes 2km (7000ft) of elevation gain and 1.5km (4700ft) of descent. Completing this race was a childhood dream, and before leaving South Africa, I had to complete it. On that day, I learned that prize is not finishing it, or the medal, but rather being part of this truly epic event. We are all Comrades.<br/><img src='/images/extra/comrade-middle.jpg?style=centerme'>"
