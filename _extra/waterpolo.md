title: "Waterpolo First Team Captain"
excerpt: "Waterpolo is a challenging sport. A sport that I was not every particularly talented at. Never the less after trying Waterpolo, I loved it. In my first two years of playing it, our team won a combined total of 1 game. Waterpolo taught me that through hard work, you can achieve anything. In my final year, I was nominated as our team captain, and as a team, we won close to 50% of our games. The lessons it taught me, and the leadership skills it gave me are still ones I use today.<br/><img src='/images/extra/polo.jpeg'>"
