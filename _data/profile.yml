description: "Building technology to make our roads safer."
bio: "My career is driven by a single focus: building a foundation of trust between technology and the real world. During my Ph.D. in Autonomous System Safety, I explored the complex pipeline of testing systems that must operate flawlessly where software, hardware, and physical interactions meet. I learned that true safety isn't just about code; it's about creating verifiable proof in a constantly changing environment.\n\nThis insight led me to my current path. I am now the founder of a new venture in stealth mode, building technology to solve this exact challenge at scale. My mission is to create a new standard for safety and trust that will underpin the future of mobility.\n\nWhether it's on the hockey field, summiting Kilimanjaro, or pushing through an ultramarathon, I thrive on solving complex challenges that demand discipline and endurance. I'm bringing that same energy to building my company."
