I held many teaching positions at the University of Pretoria. The highest position held was head teaching assistant. Below is a list of each of the courses I was involved in:

### Introduction to Programming in C (2014)
Tutoring first-year students involved attending practical sessions set by the lecturer and assisting and teaching students regarding work done in class. It also involved marking student test papers. I learned teaching and communication skills, as well as time management skills, as this was done in conjunction with my degree.

### Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2015)
Tutoring second-year students involved attending practicals sessions set by the lecturer and assisting and teaching students regarding work done in class. It also involved marking student tutorial papers. I learned teaching and communication skills at a higher level and further developing time management skills as this was done in conjunction with my degree.

### Program Design in C++ (2015)
Head tutorship involved both managerial skills as well as teaching skills. This involved organizing the teaching assistants to make sure that each TA was at the correct practical session, collecting student tutorial scripts, organizing them, and distributing them to the respective TA's. Once the tutorials had been marked, I was in charge of recording the marks and developing a computer system that would cross-reference students' marks with their student numbers. I was also involved with teaching and assisting students. The skills I learned included managing large groups of people as well as being responsible for their actions.

### Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2016)
The head tutorship involves many of the responsibilities similar to those I had previously in my first head tutor position. However, as this was a second-year course, the students' workload and technical skills required by the students were higher. I learned to accept responsibility as well as work in a much higher stress environment. I was also tasked with ensuring the students with disabilities in the subject, had all the resources they needed to succeed in their studies. Working with these students taught me to be humble, and they showed me that anything is possible through dedication.
