Tutoring second year students, this involved attending practicals set by the lecturer and assisting or teach- ing students regarding work done in Java. It also involved marking student tutorial papers. I learnt teaching and communication skills at a higher level, as well as further developing time management skills as this was done in conjunction with my degree.
