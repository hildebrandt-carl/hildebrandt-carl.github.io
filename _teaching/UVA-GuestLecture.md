As the lead lab designer for this new class, I was given numerous responsibilities. I was tasked with further developing the simulator the students would use throughout the labs. I was also asked to give a lecture on robot perception.

### Simulator

This class was taught during the COVID pandemic and thus was created as an online-only class. This meant that I was in charge of optimizing the simulator to run on virtual machines with limited and varying CPU limitations. I also updated the simulator from last year in two majors ways:

1. I upgraded the simulator from a point simulator to one that contains the drone's pose. This helped students visualize the drone's roll, pitch, and yaw and better understand the complexities of operating a drone.
2. I added new sensors to the drone, such as a down-facing camera, which allowed the students to learn and implement state-of-the-art robotic perception, such as machine learning and image process.

### Lab Design

I was tasked with designing each of the following labs for this course. More information on the course can be found on the course [website](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/), which I was also in charge of designing and maintaining:

* [Lab 1: Setting up the development environment and basic ROS](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/labs/lab1/)
* [Lab 2: ROS processes, communication, and simulation environment](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/labs/lab2/)
* [Lab 3: Representing States, System Parameterization, and Services](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/labs/lab3/)
* [Lab 5: Perception through Image Analysis](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/labs/lab5/)
* Lab 7: Mapping and Motion Planning

### Lecture

I was asked to give a lecture on the perception layer of autonomous systems. A video of my lecture is shown below. Note: parts of the lecture have been removed or edited due to privacy concerns for students which took this course.

Video coming soon.
