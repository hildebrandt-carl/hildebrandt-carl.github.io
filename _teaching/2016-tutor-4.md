The head tutorship involves many of the responsibilities similar to those I had previously in my first head tutor position. However, this is a second year course and thus there are greater consequences to my actions. I learnt to accept responsibility as well as work in a much higher stress environment. I am also currently in charge of working with students with disabilities in the subject. This taught me how to be humble, and they showed me that through hard work anything is possible.
