Head tutorship involved both managerial skills as well as teaching skills. This involved organising the tutors to make sure that each tutor was at the correct practical session, collecting student tutorial scripts organising them and distributing them to the respective tutors. Once the tutorials had been marked, I was in charge of recording the marks and developing a computer system which would cross reference students marks with their student numbers. I was also involved with teaching and assisting students. Skills I learnt included managing large groups of people as well as being responsible for their actions.
